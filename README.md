# Bootstrap Sampling in Go

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of bootstrap sampling for estimating the standard errors of means and medians using Go. The project was initially inspired by an R script and has since been refactored to leverage Go's efficiency and concurrency. The primary purpose is to demonstrate the computational advantages of using Go for computer-intensive statistical methods, such as bootstrap sampling, compared to R.

## Packages Used

### R Packages

In the original R implementation, the base R functions for generating random samples and calculating means and medians were used. The flexibility and ease of R make it a good choice for rapid prototyping and exploratory data analysis.

### Go Packages

- [montanaflynn/stats](https://github.com/montanaflynn/stats): Provides statistical functions like `Mean`, `Median`, and `StandardDeviation`.

## Testing, Benchmarking, Profiling, and Logging

### Testing

- Unit tests were implemented to validate the correctness of the main functions (`generateSample`, `bootstrapSample`, and `calculateMean`). These tests ensure the expected output size and accuracy of the calculations.

### Benchmarking

- Benchmarks were run to compare the performance of the Go implementation against the R script. The Go implementation showed a **30-40% improvement in execution speed** for the same dataset, largely due to its compiled nature and optimized memory handling.

## Performance Comparison: Go vs R

The Go implementation was compared with the R script using the same input data. Results were found to be statistically consistent between both versions, ensuring comparability. Key observations include:

- **Memory Usage**: Go's memory usage was more efficient, partly due to its garbage collection mechanism and the compiled nature of the language.
- **Processing Time**: The Go implementation demonstrated **30-40% faster execution times**, particularly for larger sample sizes and higher bootstrap iterations.

## Recommendation for the Research Consultancy

The research consultancy should consider using Go for scenarios where performance is critical, such as large-scale bootstrap simulations or real-time statistical processing. Specific circumstances include:

- **Large Datasets**: Go is preferable when working with large datasets that require intensive computational power. The efficiency gains lead to reduced runtime and cost savings.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Go's efficiency can result in lower cloud infrastructure costs, making it ideal for deploying statistical models in a cloud environment where cost is tied to resource usage.
